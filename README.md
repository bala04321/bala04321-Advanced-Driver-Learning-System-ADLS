Our project aims to revolutionize the driving experience by creating a unified system that enhances safety and efficiency in modern vehicles. By leveraging real-time data from IoT sensors and external sources, our solution focuses on two core objectives:

Proactive Safety Alerts: Advanced driver assistance features to mitigate risks based on traffic, weather, and economic conditions.
Battery Optimization: Smarter energy management for electric vehicles, improving efficiency and adapting to economic and environmental factors.
Through a robust technology stack comprising machine learning models, real-time analytics, and scalable deployment frameworks, our system delivers actionable insights for both drivers and companies.

This innovative solution not only addresses immediate needs like smarter ADAS systems and EV management but also lays the foundation for future growth, including integration with autonomous vehicles and predictive maintenance systems.
